          The 3 pillars of Practicing Yoga: Pranayama, Meditation and Asanas
        </p>
        <p>
          Yoga is a term that speaks to your body, soul and mind. It is an
          endless journey from you, to you and through you. While the practice
          of yoga may have begun for you through its physical aspects of asanas,
          it also engages with your mind and provides holistic benefits. One can
          imagine yoga to be a flourishing tree with its roots deeply woven in
          Asanas (physical postures), Meditations (calming of the mind) and
          Pranayama (conscious breath control). All three are equally important
          to master your yogic journey. You can choose to practice each pillar
          of yoga in separate sessions or incorporate them in your practice
          together. Mastering the Practice of Pranayama While the practice of
          Pranayama is aimed at controlling your breathing, a practitioner can
          also practice sitting comfortably and focusing their attention for an
          extended period, performing breathing exercises correctly that
          revitalizes your body and the spirit and also calms your mental state
          of mind. One can master their basic Hatha yoga poses before working to
          control the life force, i.e. controlling their breath through
          pranayama. Embracing Breathing with Asanas According to the guidance
          of the ancient Patanjali yoga sutra, a practitioner should not
          initiate Pranayama before practising Asana but only when one is fully
          relaxed in Shavasana and alert and not sleepy. That being said, a
          simple breathing pattern is monitored when performing your asanas.
          Later, practitioners can add gentle ujjayi breathing (victoriuos
          breath) to the pose altering patterns of long and short inhalations
          and exhalations to encourage a focus on breaths. Different schools of
          yoga may teach and practice Pranayama along with different physical
          postures or asanas. Depending on their school of belief the
          implementation of pranayama in your asanas may differ. One can
          practice Sukshma Vyama or light exercises to loosen up followed by
          Asanas, Pranayama and then Meditation. Pranayama and Meditations are
          not the same While the practice of pranayama and meditation may seem
          similar, they arenâ€™t the same. Working on the same technique involving
          concentration and breathing, Meditation is a practice focusing on the
          awareness of our thoughts and patterns, while pranayama is a practice
          of refining breathing ability and creating awareness of the flow of
          your breathing. Practising Asana, Pranayama & Meditation Beginning
          your yoga session with a five-minute meditation allows you to practice
          mindfulness using your breath as a reference point for being in the
          present. The practice of mindfulness encourages you to focus on your
          thoughts instead of getting rid of them, embracing them and letting go
          of them as you come back to your breath. This can be followed by light
          pranayama that relaxes your body and carries the fresh source of
          energy in every part of your body. Later you can continue with a full
          session of asanas with at least 10 minutes of shavasana (corpse pose)
          to help you relax. Asanas help you in removing physical blockages in
          the body and allow a free flow of energy. After you practice Asanas,
          you can indulge in a longer session of pranayama and finally practice
          30 minutes of seated meditation. Since the journey of yoga is deeply
          rooted in you, the incorporation of Meditation, Asanas and Pranayama
          in your lifestyle is largely dependent on yourself.
